# Yelp API Data Project: Exploring Korean Cuisines in Los Angeles


## Project Description:
Passionate about Korean food, I embarked on a project to showcase the rich culinary landscape of Los Angeles. With a vision of cultural connection through food, this project utilizes feature engineering and geospatial visualization to highlight Korean restaurants in the area.

## Project Structure:
Utilizing the Yelp API, I extracted and cleaned data on Korean restaurants in Los Angeles, converting it into a pandas dataframe. The project journey involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and geospatial visualization using Plotly.
