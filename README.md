# Yelp API Data Project of Korean Cuisines in Los Angeles."

## Project Description:
I am obsessed with all korean food and love sharing people around the world about how great Korean food is. In fact, I love to expand my korean culture through the lens of food. I am aiming for a world, where people can be connected, culturally, through shared dining experiences. 

## Project Structure:
For this project, I wanted to extract data from the Yelp API and explore the LA food scene.  I mainly performed API Extraction in a JSON file, then converted into a pandas dataframe. Once I got my API key from Yelp API, I loaded the data into a JSON file. I defined the terms by creating the Location and Term keyword. 

## Data Analysis Implementation:
I have learned a lot of concepts from coding efficient API Data to EDA. I am still working on developing this project. Stay Tuned. 
Here are the steps I took to identify the restaurants in Los Angeles. 
1. Get the API Key from the Yelp Developer Site. Save it to a safe place in your computer - hidden folder. 
2. Open and access the API JSON File in Jupyter Notebook. 
  - Create a function to create a JSON file
4. Convert the JSON files to pandas dataframes. 
  - All the data cleaning and EDA analysis.
5. Data Visualiation
